# Clyphx Pro repo 

This is the local config I'm using w/ CXP and decided that it might help some other people so I thought I would make it public 

This is still very much a work in progress, but the short version is that I have three devices for controling live

Softube Console 1 Fader bank
2x Midifigher Twisters

I use this both for writing/record/mixing my own musin in Live, but maybe more importantly I use it for dub mixing/remixing as well. 

I hope if people are having problems with CXP this repo might help them.
