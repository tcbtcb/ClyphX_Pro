# Below you can specify a list of MIDI Buttons to use as G-Controls as well as the Action
# Lists they should trigger when various gestures are received. The MIDI Buttons you
# specify here are expected to be momentary (send an on message when pressed and an
# off message when released).

# The entry format for each control is:
# NAME = TYPE, CHANNEL, NOTE_OR_CC, OFF_LED, ON_LED, REPEAT

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ENTRY      |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | NAME       |  A unique one-word name for the control.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | TYPE       |  The type of MIDI message the control sends (NOTE or CC).
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | CHANNEL    |  The MIDI Channel number in the range of 1-16.

# | OFF_LED    |  The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use by default and when the
# |            |  control is not pressed down. If in doubt, use 0.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ON_LED     |  The LED value in the range of 0-127 to use when the control is pressed
# |            |  down. If in doubt, use 127.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | REPEAT     |  TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the control should repeatedly trigger
# |            |  an Action List when it's pressed down.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example: MY_BTN1 = NOTE, 1, 10, 0, 127, TRUE


# After each control specification, you'll list the gestures you want to listen for and
# the Action List that should be triggered when the gesture is received.

# The entry format for each gesture is:

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | ENTRY        |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | NAME         |  The name specified for the control

# | TYPE                 |  DESCRIPTION
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | PRESSED              |  Received when the control is pressed. The Action List
# |                      |  specified for this gesture is the one that will be repeated

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | RELEASED             |  Received when the control is released. This will be received
# |                      |  any time the control is released and will be received before
# |                      |  the next two gesture types.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# | RELEASED_IMMEDIATELY |  Received when the control is released after being pressed

# a line makes the line a comment). Your list should be formatted in the same way
# except without the # at the beginning of each line.

# B1 = NOTE, 9, 9, 25, 52, FALSE
# B1 PRESSED = MUTE
# B1 RELEASED_DELAYED = MUTE

# B2 = CC, 1, 1, 0, 127, TRUE
# B2 PRESSED = VOL <5
# B2 RELEASED = VOL RESET
